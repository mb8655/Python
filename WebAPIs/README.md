# Python Pandas Practice Codes

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of practice exercises focused on developing and consuming Web APIs using Python. These exercises were developed as part of my academic coursework at New York University (NYU) during my Master's in Business Analytics program. They cover various aspects of Web API development, including creating endpoints, handling requests and responses, and integrating with client applications.

## Purpose of This Repository
The goal of this repository is to:

- Demonstrate proficiency in building and consuming Web APIs 
- Showcase practical skills developed during coursework
- Provide examples of real-world scenarios in Web API implementation

## Topics Covered
The practice files in this repository cover the following functionalities:

1) Accessing_Web_APIs_using_Python

Discuss semi-structured data. Not everything is a CSV and/or SQL.

Perhaps split Web APIs from semi-structured data, and present a discussion of semi-structured data before Web APIs. For example the Yelp API?

Perhaps migrate to Postgress and use the JSON support there. Put a Yelp dataset with JSON data in Postgress?

Discuss the issue of parsing/querying JSON/XML data. Perhaps create a semi-structured module before Web APIs. (Perhaps discuss Mongo, although the fact that Mongo queries are themselves JSON will make it kind of hard.)

Discuss XPath with some simple XML files (e.g., OpenWeatherMap returning XML?
